# The # Symbol at the start of a line counts as a Comment. To include in dialog, use a \#
# The . Symbol will cause a pause unless escaped with \. (ex: Mr. Oshiro has a pause, Mr\. Oshiro does not)
# Newlines automatically create a Page Break, unless there is an {n} command on the previous line
# Commands: Anything inside of curly braces {...} is a command and should not be translated.

# Inline Text Commands:
# {~}wavy text{/~}
# {!}impact text{/!}
# {>> x}changes speed at which characters are displayed{>>}
# {# 000000}this text is black{#} (uses HEX color values)
# {+MENU_BEGIN} inserts the dialog from the MENU_BEGIN value (in English, "CLIMB")
# {n} creates a newline, without a page break
# {0.5} creates a 0.5 second pause
# {big}this text is large{/big}

		I'm so sorry, {+MADELINE}.
		
		[BADELINE left concerned]
		Let's wake up, and we'll face this together.
		
		[MADELINE right sadder]
		...

		[MADELINE right distracted]
		No.

		[MADELINE right sad]
		Not yet.

		{trigger 8 stand up}

		[MADELINE right sad]
		I want to set things right first.
    
		[BADELINE left upset]
		What do you mean?
		
		[MADELINE right sad]
		The bird, it's trapped here because of me.
		
		{trigger 9 shift camera over to the bird}
		
		[MADELINE right sad flip]
		We need to help it escape before we leave.
		{+GRANNY} wouldn't want it to be stuck like this.
		
		[BADELINE left concerned]
		You're right. 

		[BADELINE left normal]
		Let's do it.

		[BADELINE left upset]
		But as soon as we’re done,{n}we need to wake up.

		[BADELINE left worried]
		This place is so {*}weird{/*}.{n}I want to go home.

	CH9_LAST_ROOM=
		[BADELINE right normal]
		This is it! We're almost out of here.

		[MADELINE left determined]
		Let's do this, for {+GRANNY}.

	CH9_LAST_ROOM_ALT=
		[BADELINE right concerned]
		Are you alright, {+MADELINE}?

		[MADELINE left sad]
		We're so close, but it feels impossible...

		[BADELINE right upset]
		Come on, just a few more tries.

		[BADELINE right normal]
		We can do this.

	CH9_LAST_BOOST=
		[BADELINE right normal]
		Say goodbye to her for me.

	CH9_FAREWELL=
		[MADELINE left normal]
		{+GRANNY}!

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Hey there, kiddo.
		
		[MADELINE left normal]
		It's so great to see you.
		I didn't know what to do without you.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		...
		But you aren't real...

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		This is just a dream.
		
		[GRANNY right normal]
		So what?
		That didn't stop you from coming all this way.
		You finally found me, and {~}now{/~}{n}you care that it's just a dream?
		
		[GRANNY right mock]
		Quit making excuses and{n}say what you need to say.
		
		[MADELINE left sad]
		...

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		I'm sorry that I didn't come to your funeral.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I couldn't do it... I just shut down.
		
		{silent_trigger 0 laugh}

		[GRANNY right laugh]
		Heh, that sounds familiar.
		
		[MADELINE left upset]
		...

		{silent_trigger 1 stop laughing}
		
		[GRANNY right normal]
		Hey, what do I care who showed up to that thing?

		{silent_trigger 0 laugh}

		[GRANNY right laugh]
		I'm dead!

		{silent_trigger 1 stop laughing}

		[GRANNY right mock]
		Funerals are for all you suckers{n}stuck living without me.
		
		{trigger 2 take a step forward}

		[MADELINE left normal]
		Thank you for looking out for me on the {+MOUNTAIN}.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		You helped me so much, and...

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I really miss you.

		{trigger 3 granny fades away}
		
		[MADELINE left sadder]
		What am I supposed to do now?
		Just keep going, like nothing happened?

		{silent_trigger 4 fade to white}

		[MADELINE left panic]
		Like you aren't... gone forever?

		{anchor bottom}

		[WEBCAM_THEO right excited]
		There she is!

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		Long time no see, {# F94A4A}Strawberry{#}.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Hey {+THEO}.
		
		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		It's been forever!

		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		You went off the grid!{n}What happened to you?
		
		[MADELINE left sad]
		Yeah, sorry for not responding to your messages...

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		...or answering your calls...
		...
		...or replying to your emails.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		I kind of had a breakdown when {+GRANNY} died.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		And then I felt weird messaging you.
		I thought maybe you were{n}mad at me for disappearing.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		It snowballed from there.
		
		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		Yeah yeah, I know you.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		I figured the funeral might've{n}triggered your anxiety, NBD.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		Next time, {~}at least{/~} just let me know you're still alive.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		You feeling any better?
		
		[MADELINE left sad]
		Yeah...

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		I'm finally starting to come to terms with it.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		When I first met {+GRANNY},{n}I thought she was crazy.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		But then I got to know her...

		[MADELINE left upset]
		...and I thought she was mean.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		But she knew what I needed to hear,{n}and she really helped me.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I miss her a lot.
		
		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		Yeah, me too.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		I honestly thought she'd live forever.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right excited]
		Oh! That reminds me!{n}I have to show you something.
		
		[MADELINE left normal]
		Oh?
		
		[WEBCAM_THEO right excited]
		Remember how I told you my grandpa went{n}to {+CELESTE_MOUNTAIN} when he was younger?

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		Well, I was going through{n}some of his old stuff with {+ALEX}...
		And check out this photo I found.
     
 		{trigger 0 Shows the photo of Theo's grandpa with Granny at Celeste Mountain.}
 		
 		[MADELINE left surprised]
		Is that {+GRANNY}!? With your grandpa?

		[MADELINE left normal]
		{+THEO}, that's amazing!
		It looks like they were friends.
		
		[WEBCAM_THEO right excited]
		Just like us!

		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		It really sucks that they're gone.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		But it's nice to know that we{n}shared the {+MOUNTAIN} with them.
		
		[MADELINE left normal]
		Yeah...

		[MADELINE left peaceful]
